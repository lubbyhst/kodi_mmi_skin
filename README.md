# Audi MMI skin for the media center palltform Kodi.
Audi MMI skin for the Kodi media center plattform.

This skin is based on the rns-e skin of janssuuh from https://www.janssuuh.nl/en/.

The skin should give the possibilities to extend the basic audi MMI features via a car pc. Like raspberry pi or something else.

The target is a skin for all MMI 2G or 3G systems.

# Building the skin

For building the skin. Simply execute the `createZip.sh`. This will generate a zip file in the target
folder. 
This could be installed by kodi's `install from zip file` feature.
