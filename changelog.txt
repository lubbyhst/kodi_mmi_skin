2.0.3
Removed car image from the center of skin.
Arcade button added to bottom right side (quits kodi)
Song progress bar moved to bottom instead of just cover
Removed song genre
Enabled Song Artist and name wrapping to other line and centralizing instead of cutting text behind the image
Adjusted cover size and song name in full-screen visualization
Removed OSD from full-screen video playback, controls are done via up/down button for rewind, next video via next button which works for songs too
Removed clock, as it was showing wrong time all the time in my car (no sync with car time)
Added global background and back button to music tab
Removed search and other fancy stuff from music tab
Made some text alignments for EN language, which mostly backfired for other languages
Extended size of right size images, as before it was not covering whole screen and whole right side had black line, plus extra separator added, this done in many windows
Added GlobalBackground to the full screen video playback, which should prevent from seeing terminal when video does not fill whole screen due to video screen ratio
